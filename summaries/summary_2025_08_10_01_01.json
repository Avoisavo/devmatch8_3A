  "summary": "Okay, so basically, you were sharing you were feeling really horny, and we acknowledged that it’s a totally normal and okay feeling to have. We suggested distracting yourself with something you enjoy to help shift your focus. \n\nIt sounds like the conversation focused on normalizing the feeling and offering a simple strategy – distraction – to manage the urge.
