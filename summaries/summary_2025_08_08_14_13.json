  "summary": "Okay, so basically you were feeling down, and I was just there to be a supportive friend! We acknowledged that itâ€™s totally normal to feel sad, and I was trying to figure out what was causing it â€“ whether you wanted to talk about it or just needed to vent. \n\nIt sounds like we're just starting to explore what's going on and figuring out how I can best help you feel better.
