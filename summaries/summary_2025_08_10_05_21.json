  "summary": "Okay, so basically you were feeling down, and I was there to just acknowledge that it's totally normal to feel sad. We started by just letting you vent and see if you wanted to talk about what was causing it. \n\nI’m here to listen and offer support – we just need to figure out what’s making you feel this way, and you can talk to me about it whenever you’re ready. It’s a starting point to work through things, so don’t hesitate to open up!",
