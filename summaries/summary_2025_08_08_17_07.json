  "summary": "Okay, so basically, we just had a super chill little chat! It started with a friendly \"hello\" and we just checked in with each other â€“ you said hi and asked what was up. \n\nIt seemed like we were just aiming to connect and see if you needed anything or wanted to talk about something.
