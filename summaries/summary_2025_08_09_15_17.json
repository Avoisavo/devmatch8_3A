  "summary": "Okay, so basically you were feeling really down today, and I was there to offer support. We talked about acknowledging those feelings and recognizing it's totally okay to not be feeling great. \n\nThe main thing is, I wanted to help you process what's going on â€“ specifically, I asked what was causing you to feel sad and if you wanted to chat about it. It sounds like I'm here to listen and offer a friendly ear whenever you need it! Just remember to take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out.",
