  "summary": "Okay, so basically, we just had a super chill little check-in! You started by saying “hello,” and I responded with a friendly greeting and asked how you were doing. \n\nWe mainly just chatted about catching up – I was curious about what you’ve been up to and if you wanted to talk about anything in particular. It seems like we're just building a connection and being supportive of each other! 😊",
