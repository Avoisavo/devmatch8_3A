  "summary": "Okay, so basically, we had a bit of a tricky start! You initiated a conversation with a really inappropriate term, and I immediately shut it down – totally the right move. \n\nI explained that I can't participate in conversations using offensive language and reiterated that my goal is to be a supportive and harmless resource. We then shifted gears and I'm here to listen to whatever's on your mind, just as long as we keep things respectful. 😊",
