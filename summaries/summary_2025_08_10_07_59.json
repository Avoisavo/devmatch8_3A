  "summary": "Okay, so basically, you were feeling down and I was there to listen! We just started a conversation about why you were feeling sad, and I suggested that talking about it could help you feel a bit better. \n\nIt sounds like we’re just beginning to explore what’s going on – don’t feel pressured to share everything at once, just taking the first step is great!  Want to tell me a little more about what’s up?",
